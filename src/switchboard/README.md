# Switchboard Corpus
## Training data (Switchboard corpus)
About the Switchboard corpus

    This is conversational telephone speech collected as 2-channel, 8kHz-sampled data. We are using just the Switchboard-1 Phase 1 training data. The catalog number **LDC97S62** (Switchboard-1 Release 2) corresponds, we believe, to what we have. We also use the Mississippi State transcriptions, which we download separately from [here](http://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/switchboard/releases/switchboard_word_alignments.tar.gz)


## Additional training data (Fisher-English corpus)
About the Fisher-English corpus

    This is conversational telephone speech collected as 2-channel, 8kHz-sampled data. The data is similar to Switchboard but the transcription was mostly done in a "faster", lower-quality way.

    Fisher comes in two parts, and the text and speech have separate LDC numbers. This recipe uses both parts. The LDC numbers are

    The speech: **LDC2004S13**, **LDC2005S13**
    The text: **LDC2004T19**, **LDC2005T19**


## Evaluation data1 (eval2000)
    We are using the eval2000 a.k.a. hub5'00 evaluation
    data. The LDC numbers are

    The speech: **LDC2002S09**
    The text: **LDC2002T43**
